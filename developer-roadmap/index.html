                <h2>It can be daunting</h2>
                <p>Tech is changing fast. The way we do things today is completely different from how we used to do
                    them a couple of years ago. With so much going on in the tech these days, it can be daunting for
                    anyone beginning their career or even already in this field.</p>

                <h2>Know what you don't know</h2>
                <p>Knowing what you don't know is half the battle; this would help you steer your efforts in the
                    right direction. These developer roadmaps help you in finding out the missing links, identify
                    the loopholes in your knowledge and start improving â€“ whether it is frontend, backend or
                    devops.</p>

                <p>No one got where they are in one day, it needs time and practice. Let your established ideals not
                    put you off, they got to that point with practice; you have to start somewhere. Pick a path,
                    identify what you need to know and start improving yourself.</p>
